# ComfyUI Layer Style Advance

[中文说明点这里](./README_CN.MD)    


The nodes detached from [ComfyUI Layer Style](https://github.com/chflame163/ComfyUI_LayerStyle) are mainly those with complex requirements for dependency packages.
 
 

## Example workflow

Some JSON workflow files in the    ```workflow``` directory, That's examples of how these nodes can be used in ComfyUI.

## How to install

(Taking ComfyUI official portable package and Aki ComfyUI package as examples, please modify the dependency environment directory for other ComfyUI environments)

### Install plugin

* Recommended use ComfyUI Manager for installation.

* Or open the cmd window in the plugin directory of ComfyUI, like ```ComfyUI\custom_nodes```，type    
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/chflame163/ComfyUI_LayerStyle_Advance.git
  ```

* Or download the zip file and extracted, copy the resulting folder to ```ComfyUI\custom_nodes```    

### Install dependency packages

* for ComfyUI official portable package, double-click the ```install_requirements.bat``` in the plugin directory, for Aki ComfyUI package double-click on the ```install_requirements_aki.bat``` in the plugin directory, and wait for the installation to complete.

* Or install dependency packages, open the cmd window in the ComfyUI_LayerStyle plugin directory like 
  ```ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI_LayerStyle_Advance``` and enter the following command,

&emsp;&emsp;for ComfyUI official portable package, type:

```
..\..\..\python_embeded\python.exe -s -m pip install .\whl\docopt-0.6.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl
..\..\..\python_embeded\python.exe -s -m pip install .\whl\hydra_core-1.3.2-py3-none-any.whl
..\..\..\python_embeded\python.exe -s -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\repair_dependency.bat
```

&emsp;&emsp;for Aki ComfyUI package, type:

```
..\..\python\python.exe -s -m pip install .\whl\docopt-0.6.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl
..\..\python\python.exe -s -m pip install .\whl\hydra_core-1.3.2-py3-none-any.whl
..\..\python\python.exe -s -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\repair_dependency.bat
```

* Restart ComfyUI.

### Download Model Files

Chinese domestic users from  [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1T_uXMX3OKIWOJLPuLijrgA?pwd=1yye)  and other users from [huggingface.co/chflame163/ComfyUI_LayerStyle](https://huggingface.co/chflame163/ComfyUI_LayerStyle/tree/main)  
download all files and copy them to ```ComfyUI\models``` folder. This link provides all the model files required for this plugin.
Or download the model file according to the instructions of each node.    
Some nodes named "Ultra" will use the vitmatte model, download the [vitmatte model](https://huggingface.co/hustvl/vitmatte-small-composition-1k/tree/main) and copy to ```ComfyUI/models/vitmatte``` folder, it is also included in the download link above. 

## Common Issues

If the node cannot load properly or there are errors during use, please check the error message in the ComfyUI terminal window. The following are common errors and their solutions.

### Warning: xxxx.ini not found, use default xxxx..

This warning message indicates that the ini file cannot be found and does not affect usage. If you do not want to see these warnings, please modify all ```*.ini.example``` files in the plugin directory to ```*.ini```.

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psd_tools'

This error is that the ```psd_tools``` were not installed correctly.   

Solution:

* Close ComfyUI and open the terminal window in the plugin directory and execute the following command:
  ```../../../python_embeded/python.exe -s -m pip install psd_tools```
  If error occurs during the installation of psd_tool, such as ```ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'docopt'``` , please download [docopt's whl](https://www.piwheels.org/project/docopt/) and manual install it. 
  execute the following command in terminal window:
  ```../../../python_embeded/python.exe -s -m pip install path/docopt-0.6.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl``` the ```path``` is path name of whl file.

### Cannot import name 'guidedFilter' from 'cv2.ximgproc'

This error is caused by incorrect version of the ```opencv-contrib-python``` package，or this package is overwriteen by other opencv packages. 

### NameError: name 'guidedFilter' is not defined

The reason for the problem is the same as above.

### Cannot import name 'VitMatteImageProcessor' from 'transformers'

This error is caused by the low version of ```transformers``` package. 

### insightface Loading very slow

This error is caused by the low version of ```protobuf``` package. 

#### For the issues with the above three dependency packages, please double click ```repair_dependency.bat``` (for Official ComfyUI Protable) or  ```repair_dependency_aki.bat``` (for ComfyUI-aki-v1.x) in the plugin folder to automatically fix them.

### onnxruntime::python::CreateExecutionProviderInstance CUDA_PATH is set but CUDA wasn't able to be loaded. Please install the correct version of CUDA and cuDNN as mentioned in the GPU requirements page

Solution:
Reinstall the  ```onnxruntime``` dependency package.

### Error loading model xxx: We couldn't connect to huggingface.co ...

Check the network environment. If you cannot access huggingface.co normally in China, try modifying the huggingface_hub package to force the use hf_mirror.

* Find ```constants.py``` in the directory of ```huggingface_hub``` package (usually ```Lib/site packages/huggingface_hub``` in the virtual environment path),
  Add a line after ```import os```
  
  ```
  os.environ['HF_ENDPOINT'] = 'https://hf-mirror.com'
  ```

### ValueError: Trimap did not contain foreground values (xxxx...)

This error is caused by the mask area being too large or too small when using the ```PyMatting``` method to handle the mask edges.    

Solution:

* Please adjust the parameters to change the effective area of the mask. Or use other methods to handle the edges.

### Requests.exceptions.ProxyError: HTTPSConnectionPool(xxxx...)

When this error has occurred, please check the network environment.

### UnboundLocalError: local variable 'clip_processor' referenced before assignment
### UnboundLocalError: local variable 'text_model' referenced before assignment
If this error occurs when executing ```JoyCaption2``` node and it has been confirmed that the model file has been placed in the correct directory, 
please check the ```transformers``` dependency package version is at least 4.43.2 or higher.
If ```transformers``` version is higher than or equal to 4.45.0, and also have error message:
```
Error loading models: De️️scriptors cannot be created directly.                                                                                           
If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.                                
......
```
Please try downgrading the ```protobuf``` dependency package to 3.20.3, or set environment variables: ```PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python```.



## Update

**If the dependency package error after updating,  please double clicking ```repair_dependency.bat``` (for Official ComfyUI Protable) or  ```repair_dependency_aki.bat``` (for ComfyUI-aki-v1.x) in the plugin folder to reinstall the dependency packages.
